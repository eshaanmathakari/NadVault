# NadVault
NadVault is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Monad testnet, combining three innovative features:

1. **Mystery Box Launchpad**: Creators can launch NFT-based mystery boxes with a fixed floor price (e.g., 0.1 MON), and users can bid in auctions to win exclusive digital collectibles.
2. **Wallet Activity Analyzer**: An AI-powered agent (simplified for insights) fetches and displays users' blockchain activity on the Monad testnet, including transaction history and a basic wallet ranking system.
3. **Time-Locked Vaults**: Users can lock tokens and personal memories (notes, images) for a set period, pay a subscription fee, and earn yield upon unlocking.

Built using Solidity, React, Ethers.js, and IPFS, NadVault showcases the power of Monad's high-performance blockchain for micro-interactions like bidding, subscriptions, and real-time data fetching.
